Cell["\<\
\tInstead of viewing a multiway system as a single tractable computation like \
you might for singleway systems, it seems more descriptive to study how it \
evolves holistically based on its causal graph. I believe that a universal \
multiway system is one whose causal graph can be sliced in some way to \
correspond to any other causal graph. Based on our understanding of Wolfram \
physics models, this idea may seem so obvious it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s silly - \
it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s much like saying that a universal system is one which \
behaves like the universe. However, I think this might be the most accurate \
definition, as well as a broadly applicable and powerful idea. 
\tAnything that we can experience as humans embedded in the universe must \
correspond to some slice through its causal graph. So, it follows that any \
computational system we study can be viewed this way as well, though the \
slice is probably at a higher layer of emulation on top of the basic \
universal structure. With this definition of universality, that means that a \
system is universal if it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a slice of the universe which \
contains enough information to completely describe itself.
\tThe key insight of this idea is that studying different types of systems is \
really studying the universe from different angles and at different levels of \
abstraction. A well-defined computational system is then one coherent slice \
from the causal graph of the universe, while a field like economics is in \
effect trying to piece together many separate or loosely connected slices. \
So, whether or not this is a useful definition comes down to the question of \
if it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s possible for a piece of the universe to emulate \
itself, which intuitively seems likely. There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s questions \
about if it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s feasible to find these corresponding causal \
slices, how to look for them, and how to prove full universality.
\tOne interesting question from this idea is about the type of system that \
could fully describe the universe. Wolfram physics models use multiway \
hypergraphs, but is this the only possibility, or even the one which emulates \
the universe at the lowest possible level? Is using one rule the best way to \
describe the universe, or would simulating rulial space on top of branchial \
space (along with spacelike and timelike space) show the behavior of the \
universe at a lower level of emulation? What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the \
relationship between which of these spaces are included in a system and how \
much computation or how many levels of abstraction it takes to emulate \
different kinds of systems? Is branchlike space a necessary piece of the base \
description for a multiway universal system, or can it fully emerge from a \
singleway system?
\tThere are many questions to ask about this description of universality as \
well as universality in general, and my thoughts about this are still jumbled \
and unrefined, but I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m hoping for some feedback on whether \
or not this is a useful or even coherent idea. In any case, I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]d very much like to do a full investigation of the \
phenomenon of universality and/or multiway systems in general if I can get \
the chance.\
